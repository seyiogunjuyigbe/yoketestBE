TODO: 

To create an interactive dashboard which pinpoints potential COVID-19 patients by location (sample: https://covid19.yokeserver.com/). Sample patient is provided in the Mongo DB Dump collection called 'requests', patient symptoms are provided in the collection called 'symptoms'.


Steps
---
- Set up a NodeJS project which has two (2) routes
	- A route which pulls patient requests based on date ranges and symptoms
	- A route which pulls a list of symptoms
- Set up the dashboard using any javascript framework of your choice (Vue, React, Angular..etc) which displays the patient request data on the map as illustrated in the sample
- Dashboard users should be able to filter results by date and symptom
- Feel free to add any improvements you feel are needed to the dashboard

Notes
---
Request data dates in the database ranges March 2020 - May 2020


Deliverables
- link to working dashboard
- links to git repos (dashboard and API)
